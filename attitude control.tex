\chapter{Attitude Control}

Currently the team is working on development of an attitude control system using magnetorquer. The magnetorquer rods are activated in such a way that we can produce the required torque.

Torque generated by a single magnetorquer rod is given by:
$$\vec{T}=\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}$$

Where $ \mu$ is the magnetic moment of the torquer given by
$$\mu = $$
And B is the magnetic field of earth in body frame given by the magnetorquer

If $\hat{r_N}$ is the required direction vector that the cubesat needs to be pointed in the inertial frame,

$$ \hat{r_B} = [BN]\hat{r_N}$$
$$ \hat{T} = k(\hat{r_B}- \hat{p_B})$$

where $\hat{p_B}$ is the direction vector of the cubesat with resopect to the body frame

and k is a control parameter
