\chapter{Designing the actual Helmholtz Coil}

\vspace{15pt}

In this design we used iron as the core with diameter 5.5mm and number of turns 1088 and gauge 28SWG. 

We tested it theoretically using the code written by ourself and practically using the magnetometer. Both the tests did not yield the desired result. So we decided to use Stainless steel FR430 instead of iron core and change the number of turns to 350.



\subsection{Aim}

\subsection{Components used:}

\vspace{15pt}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Plywood frame with diameter 50cm
  \item 14SWG Copper wire
  
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Procedure}
We wound the wire around the plywood frame ,150 turns per coil, which was calculated from the formula.The Helmholtz coil is designed to produce 8mT magnetic field and   current .
